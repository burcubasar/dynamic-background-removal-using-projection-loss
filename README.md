# Dynamic Background Removal Using Projection Loss

[Code upload is In Progress]

This work was presented at the Scoiety for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance 25th Annual Scientific Sessions (abstract here: https://scmr.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Selected-Abstracts-scmr-smal.pdf). It descirbes a deep learning based method to dynamically remove background signal from interventional cardiac MRI images to isolate guidewires during a procedure in real-time. The architecture is a modified U-Net. It uses a projection loss to remove cardiac and respiratory motion to isolate the guidewire signal.

Please see the Wiki page for more details on the project. 

The code will be uploaded within the next week or so.
